              Hello, I am Juho Lehtim√§ki, <strong>frontend developer</strong>{" "}
              and <strong>designer</strong> who is eager to learn more about
              website design. I currently live in Tampere where I have been
              studying computer science in University of Tampere for over 3
              years now. During my time there I have been working on multiple
              projects where I have been mostly doing frontend but I also have a
              good understanding of how backends work. I constantly try to
              develop, which allows me to write better and cleaner code, and
              create more complex projects.
            </p>
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};
